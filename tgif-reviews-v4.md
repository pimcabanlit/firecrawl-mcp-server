The bar are great places to meet up with fellow ex pats or travelers from all over the world. I would often go to the one in Alabang and get take out but first have a few pints in the bar.\n\n[value engineered!!!](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r140828891-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - there was a time that you were just happy for this resto...but now, it's like the number of fries were counted, there is a certain volume of mayo and ketchup that can only be put....ice tea sucks (it was better before) servings went down really fast.... hay!!!\n\n[...] - Just like any T.G.I. Friday's. It's slightly better thanks to the Filipino staff who is quite friendly, but then it's nothing worth bragging about.\n\n[Good Value](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r134896014-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - If you want a break from the smaller asian serving in restaurants, you found your place here. The servings are huge, so don't overorder unless you plan to bring some home. We had the nachos for an appetizer...and it could have been enough for a meal for 4 people. Food was good quality. Drinks were watered down and the mixed drinks were awful. Thy serious need a new bartender. Don't waste your money ordering a mixed drink here.\n\n[Usual TGi's](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r134590540-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - Good service, usual TGI food, great with friend, loved the party atmosphere.\n\n[American chain restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r134162517-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - Pretty ordinary restaurant, servings were large and the service ok. Not an interesting menu.\n\n[Some of my favorite things...](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r132003738-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - ...can be found here. Adobo, weird huh? But they have! And I love it. Chicken fingers with honey mustard are getting a bit generic with other restos offering it as a staple but it's still a favorite, especially with my kids, along with their fries. I super miss their broccoli cheese soup which is always unavailable. No prob, because the french onion soup is always onhand and consistently savory with its chewy mozzarella topping. I forgot what it's called but they have this new cheese dish that goes with nachos...it's a must try. And of course, their margarita...so refreshing. It's one of my top 5 of places to eat in Eastwood.\n\n[Cocktails can be improve](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r128960716-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - As usual the serving per meal is good enough 1-2 .... the selection consistent throughout the years.... but the cocktails can be improved esp margarita we tried a no of times its missing consistency (eastwood)\n\n[Average Food - Unreasonable Prices](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r128621000-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - TGI Fridays outlets generally charge way too much compared to the quality and amount of food they offer. There are a lot better places to go in Manila. I also highly recommended not to sign up to their discount card, because every time you want to use you will get another reason why its not possible. Its a rip-off!\n\n[tnx god its friday](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r127910705-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - tgif is so good i think d food i ordered was baby back ribs and it was so nice.. tgif kinda expensive but its worth it, the food , tje ambiance, the staff ....nothing but a good time...\n\n[G.I. Joe's fave](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r125271250-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - Food is great and the place rocks!  Local adaptations are excellent. Good variety of meats although their chicken dishes could use some re-working.  Pasta not their strong suit either.  Pricey.\n\n[Internationally wonderful](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r125100073-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - What can I say TGI, one of the very best.. thanks for the great service and product that are served..... I am as happy as Larry.\n\n[Okay food, sketchy service](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r124698638-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html) - Decided to try out the T.G.I. Friday's on Ft Bonifacio Highstreet (Manila). The food was okay, but really nothing special."
