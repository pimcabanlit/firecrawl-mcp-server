The first time we went there, everyone ordered a separate entree and it ended up being too much food, so the 2nd time around, we were smarter and the lighter eaters choose to share their main dishes, and ordered an appetizer. . .that worked out better for us.\\\",\\\"value\\\":3,\\\"service\\\":3,\\\"food\\\":3,\\\"atmosphere\\\":3},{\\\"reviewer\\\":\\\"oneiloilokano\\\",\\\"date\\\":\\\"Jul 2011\\\",\\\"rating\\\":5,\\\"comment\\\":\\\"We were a party of 12 and sat outside in the cafe's spacious patio. Our food was served promptly and everyone was pleased with the food. They serve stateside portions so bring your appetite. The only noticible differance between this TGI Fridays and one stateside is they serve rice with the entrees. Expect to pay $ prices as this place is not cheap, but it was well worth it.\\\",\\\"value\\\":4,\\\"service\\\":5,\\\"food\\\":5,\\\"atmosphere\\\":5}]\"\n}",
