The bar are great places to meet up with fellow ex pats or travelers from all over the world. I would often go to the one in Alabang and get take out but first have a few pints in the bar.",

      "reviewText": "If you want a break from the smaller asian serving in restaurants, you found your place here. The servings are huge, so don't overorder unless you plan to bring some home. We had the nachos for an appetizer...and it could have been enough for a meal for 4 people. Food was good quality. Drinks were watered down and the mixed drinks were awful. Thy serious need a new bartender. Don't waste your money ordering a mixed drink here.",

      "reviewText": "...can be found here. Adobo, weird huh? But they have! And I love it. Chicken fingers with honey mustard are getting a bit generic with other restos offering it as a staple but it's still a favorite, especially with my kids, along with their fries. I super miss their broccoli cheese soup which is always unavailable. No prob, because the french onion soup is always onhand and consistently savory with its chewy mozzarella topping. I forgot what it's called but they have this new cheese dish that goes with nachos...it's a must try. And of course, their margarita...so refreshing. It's one of my top 5 of places to eat in Eastwood.",

I also highly recommended not to sign up to their discount card, because every time you want to use you will get another reason why its not possible. Its a rip-off!",

      "reviewText": "Decided to try out the T.G.I. Friday's on Ft Bonifacio Highstreet (Manila). The food was okay, but really nothing special. We had the citrus fruit salad, which supposedly came with goat cheese, pomelo and pecans. My kids had a good laugh about it...... 2 small fragments of pomelo, 2 dice-sized pieces of goat cheese and some crumbs, which turned out to be the pecans. All together there could not have been more than 1 tea spoon of pecans in the salad. And that is for the 'to share' (biggest size) order of the salad, almost $15! The salad did consist of lots of lettuce; that and 4 jumbo prawns. We had some fajitas too, and they were very good. Was asked if we wanted guacemole with it, but when we said that we only wanted it if it was fresh, the waitress came back and whispered that actually the guacemole comes out of a plastic container. Yuk! So we passed on the guacemole, which is a shame in a country that has plenty of avocado's available. The waitress was nice, but after she brought out our orders, she was nowhere to be seen, so we had to borrow some staff from another part of the restaurant to get some water and a clean plate. They charge a fixed service charge which is good for them, because I would probably not have tipped based on the service. The fruit drinks are all bogus..... no fresh fruit is used, only lots of syrup and even more ice. Paid php 330 (some $8) for two glasses of ice with a bit of soda water and a bit of strawberry syrup. Better to stick with water or canned drinks.....",
