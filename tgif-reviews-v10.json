Our food was served promptly and everyone was pleased with the food. They serve stateside portions so bring your appetite. The only noticible differance between this TGI Fridays and one stateside is they serve rice with the entrees. Expect to pay $ prices as this place is not cheap, but it was well worth it.\",\n      \"reviewerName\": \"oneiloilokano\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
