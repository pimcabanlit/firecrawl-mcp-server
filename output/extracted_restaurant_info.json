The Caesar salad felt more like Caesar salad dressing with salad rather than salad with dressing. Far too much sauce. The mussels Lombardi were nice and fresh but the sauce was very watery and bland. Service was ok.\",\n    \"Horrible Italian food. Margherita Pizza was a joke. Two sprigs of basil on top of smoked gouda cheese. When I asked for an Aperal Spritz, the waitress looked at me funny. So I went to the bar and asked. Was told no, we don't have it, nor do they have Limoncello. Was I in an Italian restaurant or not. Two staple drinks in Italy and they don't serve. Oddly enough, my hotel, the Seda, does. So don't waste your time or money on this chain restaurant. There have to be better places in Makati, so keep hunting.\",\n    \"A chain of Italian restaurants located in a mall in Manila. I tried chicken pancakes, roasted pancakes, pulp, salad, large portions, good level, but the taste of pulp is strange.\",\n    \"Italianni's Restaurant offers a delightful Italian dining experience. The ambiance is warm, and the service is attentive. The menu features a variety of classic Italian dishes with flavorful ingredients. Standouts include their pasta dishes and delicious desserts. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service.\",\n    \"The place has deteriorated massively! Their pasta come greasy with old oil definitely too hard. For some reason the can no longer make an Italian Pizza, you get either a square piece of Pizza without crust, or a “thick” one from the pan. Anyone who has ever eaten in Italy would turn away in disgust. Where is the management, if any exists?\",\n    \"Steak was ok. not so tender. The bread they served was cold. Pasta vongole was good. Service from the receptionists were excellent as well as our server. the carbonaro was so so. Pizza was good. Ceasar salad was good as well as the other salad with mango. I forgot the name.\",\n    \"Italiannis at Glorieta should be sanctioned by the Bistro Group if they care at all about how and what they serve their clients. The porkchop, one of their specialties could not be sliced with the knife due to toughness; manager Carlos did say that the batch was indeed tough- huh? So why did they serve it? The salmon pasta was tasteless and when waitress Iya was asked to replace it , she told us that the dish will be charged to her. Really??? After the terrible dining experience, no apologies from manager or erring waitress. Enough said. Banned.\",\n    \"Food is great and servers are fast. Place is very crowded during dinner time. Server that serves us is very attentive and efficient.\",\n    \"BAD customer service. Their staff doesn't uderstand each other. Their server Eve reserved us a table but their receptionist gave the table to other customers. The Manager just said it's a miscommunication between their staffs but did not do anything. We ended up having lunch in Rumba w/c is better.\",\n    \"I had great time eating Delicious food laat your restaurant. The waitress were committed to great service and were very friendly. The atmosphere was awesome and i definitely liked that you have a very modern style. Most importantly, every foods and drinks on your menu tasted great!!!\",\n    \"The food was very good, i loved the ravioli. Definitely would go back here to eat again, very nice employees and helpful. We had a good time here and didn’t need to make a reservation although it’s was busy.\",\n    \"the only thing this place is good for is ripping people off. We bought a pizza for 700 pesos, and there was more content in a snickers bar. To hide the fact there was only a teaspoonful of cheese, 3 small pieces of pineapple chunks, they sliced a tomato and hoped it hid the fact there was practically nothing, and I mean nothing in it, or on it!\",\n    \"Greenbelt Makati branch was quite unpleasant. Im quite not sure how the managers assigned table allocations but it was noticeable to only have 1 staff who roam around on floor. No mainstays to cater to guest needs. I have to raise my hand several occassions just coz staffs ( including manager & not not sure the other lady in her casual wear) was too busy with im not quite sure with what. At this point were only 7 tables inside (16pax). Not to mention that the caucasian male next to my table has a different way of staff delivering their spiels. Staff was able to even update him with his order while for me was nothing at all. Simply irritating, all your guest pays exactly the same for you guys not to give a standard service. Also, you guys are ripping off your clients, the price for clam chowder soup is expensive for it to be only serve in a small rice bowl... not to mention that there is nothing much in there. Please ensure to change this as your clients have limited time to really drop by your restaurant. Least you can do is make it exceptional. But again, clearly not for today.\"\n  ],\n  \"average_rating\": 3.6\n}",
