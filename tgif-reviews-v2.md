The bar are great places to meet up with fellow ex pats or travelers from all over the world. I would often go to the one in Alabang and get take out but first have a few pints in the bar.\n\n[value engineered!!!](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r140828891-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): there was a time that you were just happy for this resto...but now, it's like the number of fries were counted, there is a certain volume of mayo and ketchup that can only be put....ice tea sucks (it was better before) servings went down really fast.... hay!!!\n\n[...](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r136128223-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): Just like any T.G.I. Friday's. It's slightly better thanks to the Filipino staff who is quite friendly, but then it's nothing worth bragging about.\n\n[Good Value](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r134896014-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): If you want a break from the smaller asian serving in restaurants, you found your place here. The servings are huge, so don't overorder unless you plan to bring some home. We had the nachos for an appetizer...and it could have been enough for a meal for 4 people. Food was good quality. Drinks were watered down and the mixed drinks were awful. Thy serious need a new bartender. Don't waste your money ordering a mixed drink here.\n\n[Usual TGi's](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r134590540-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): Good service, usual TGI food, great with friend, loved the party atmosphere.\n\n[American chain restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r134162517-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): Pretty ordinary restaurant, servings were large and the service ok. Not an interesting menu.\n\n[Some of my favorite things...](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r132003738-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): ...can be found here. Adobo, weird huh? But they have! And I love it. Chicken fingers with honey mustard are getting a bit generic with other restos offering it as a staple but it's still a favorite, especially with my kids, along with their fries. I super miss their broccoli cheese soup which is always unavailable. No prob, because the french onion soup is always onhand and consistently savory with its chewy mozzarella topping. I forgot what it's called but they have this new cheese dish that goes with nachos...it's a must try. And of course, their margarita...so refreshing. It's one of my top 5 of places to eat in Eastwood.\n\n[Cocktails can be improve](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r128960716-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): As usual the serving per meal is good enough 1-2 .... the selection consistent throughout the years.... but the cocktails can be improved esp margarita we tried a no of times its missing consistency (eastwood)\n\n[Average Food - Unreasonable Prices](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r128621000-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): TGI Fridays outlets generally charge way too much compared to the quality and amount of food they offer. There are a lot better places to go in Manila. I also highly recommended not to sign up to their discount card, because every time you want to use you will get another reason why its not possible. Its a rip-off!\n\n[tnx god its friday](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r127910705-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): tgif is so good i think d food i ordered was baby back ribs and it was so nice.. tgif kinda expensive but its worth it, the food , tje ambiance, the staff ....nothing but a good time... the last first branch i visited was robinsons manila and the somehow d last was in davao.\n\n[G.I. Joe's fave](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r125271250-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): Food is great and the place rocks!  Local adaptations are excellent. Good variety of meats although their chicken dishes could use some re-working.  Pasta not their strong suit either.  Pricey.\n\n[Internationally wonderful](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r125100073-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): What can I say TGI, one of the very best.. thanks for the great service and product that are served..... I am as happy as Larry.\n\n[Okay food, sketchy service](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g298573-d2201474-r124698638-TGI_Friday_s-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html): Decided to try out the T.G.I. Friday's on Ft Bonifacio Highstreet (Manila). The food was okay, but really nothing special. We had the citrus fruit salad, which supposedly came with goat cheese, pomelo and pecans. My kids had a good laugh about it...... 2 small fragments of pomelo, 2 dice-sized pieces of goat cheese and some crumbs, which turned out to be the pecans. All together there could not have been more than 1 tea spoon of pecans in the salad. And that is for the 'to share' (biggest size) order of the salad, almost $15! The salad did consist of lots of lettuce; that and 4 jumbo prawns. We had some fajitas too, and they were very good. Was asked if we wanted guacemole with it, but when we said that we only wanted it if it was fresh, the waitress came back and whispered that actually the guacemole comes out of a plastic container. Yuk! So we passed on the guacemole, which is a shame in a country that has plenty of avocado's available. The waitress was nice, but after she brought out our orders, she was nowhere to be seen, so we had to borrow some staff from another part of the restaurant to get some water and a clean plate. They charge a fixed service charge which is good for them, because I would probably not have tipped based on the service. The fruit drinks are all bogus..... no fresh fruit is used, only lots of syrup and even more ice. Paid php 330 (some $8) for two glasses of ice with a bit of soda water and a bit of strawberry syrup. Better to stick with water or canned drinks....."
